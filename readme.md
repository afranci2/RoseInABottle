## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

**Server:** Javascript, Node, Express

Created static site using HTML and CSS
Called in this  year to add functionality and redesign and backend admin with team
Created a website for non profit religious organizations to track different churches around the globe for visitors to learn. Made in React with Tailwind and Node and Express and Next js.  Add payment processing for transactions only and accepted donations through third parties and provided GPS tracking and church search. Responsive as well with embed live stream

Scrum with another person on monte website
SPLIT INTO TWO PARTS - first was html and css, but then wanted functionality and rebranding
Made monte website with html and css but encountered many issues
Takes a long time to make with only css and html
No interactivity (include live stream in other way than embed (facebook live only allows embed after each  live stream is made, meaning we would have to make the stream and add the facebook embed code every time to the website) (also want to include map to track locations and help find church easier) (also want to add forms for volunteering ) (also want tithely functionality)
There are no object. If we wanted to add a section of a page, or add an event specifically the task is time-consuming and tedious. With react you can make an object and add an event. 
Overall, more components and classes.
Step two was make monte website with react
Afterwards use client side  routing and dynamic routing and faster load time for the first contentful pain. Also clean up folders and classes
UI is messy and trashy and not perfect, so we use a CSS preprocessor SASS to add variables and nesting, uses mixin to group style and conditional logic for different browsers and [post css to compress all the css and minify it. Used bootstrap then tailwind to style UI. Bootstrap already has pre made components but are hard to customize. Tailwind gets rid of need for media query as its more responsive and removes need to switch back and forth between jsx and css. You get lost with CSS classes they get more and more complex. Module css fixes this a little but tailwind removes need to make individual class names. MOST IMPORTANT You can create a UI quick without need for figma or adobe XD. Used material UI for a little but wanted more customization. When making monte website most of the time was spent on UI. Going back in forth with style. Some style characteristics that needed to look professional but just werenâ€™t. I ended up needing a design review which pushed back production even more. They also have customized styles. Makes complex css easier. Shadow, mix blend, and gradients. Grid is also easy to understand compared to regular css.
We then needed to add next js for seo purposes and faster first contentful paint renderi g



## Optimizations

What optimizations did you make in your code? E.g. refactors, performance improvements, accessibility

This is part two of this project. These are the optimizations
## Lessons Learned
Animations: add animation similar to https://www.revolut.com/en-US/ when hovering over cards
