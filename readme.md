## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Liquid

The website's custom HTML, CSS, and Liquid site template were specifically designed to improve site speed, replacing the previously used slow and cumbersome template by Debutify and plugins from Shopify. Shopify provides backend payments, while debutify offers frontend components and animations. The custom template leverages Shopify plugins, including Shopify Payments, Judge.me reviews, and TikTok/Facebook Advertising API and functionality.


## Optimizations

What optimizations did you make in your code? E.g. refactors, performance improvements, accessibility

IMPROVED WEBSITE PERFORMANCE: 
Reduced render-blocking elements by using "defer" and "async" attributes in script tags within the head section and minimized the impact of third-party code.

Identified non-critical CSS and JS: the team used Chrome DevTools' Coverage tab to identify and eliminate redundant resources that appeared in red.

Deferred resource loading: the team replaced the "img" tag with "amp-img" to defer resource loading.

Utilized Chrome DevTools and PageSpeed Insights: the team optimized page speed and boosted the page speed score from 25 to 64, resulting in a 3% conversion rate for the store, compared to 1% the previous year.

Optimized page speed: the team optimized page speed by converting images to WebP, compressing unused JavaScript and CSS, and adding "async" and "defer" attributes to header tags.
